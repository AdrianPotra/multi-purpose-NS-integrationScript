# multi-purpose-NS-integrationScript

## Description 
Multi Purpose Integration Oracle NetSuite RESTlet script file written as SuiteScript 2.1 using classes and inheritance. 
It was designed for demo purposes to highlight the fact how the new ECMAscript syntax can be used within NetSuite to create a single integration script handling multiple record types in NetSuite without writing too much code and overcomplicating the script. This script can be used as a base template for a larger integration project including multiple transaction records in NetSuite. 
This template script covers only the creation of Sales Orders and Invoices, but it can be easily extended to other transactional records as well. 
I will not describe further steps on how to use this, as a NetSuite Developer would know on how to deploy this script in a NetSuite environment and how to call the Restlet endpoint from an HTTP client using OAuth 1.0 or 2.0, after Integration and access tokens have been set up.
